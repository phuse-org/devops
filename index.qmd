## Welcome to the home of **PharmaDevOps**
This PHUSE working group is focussed on ensuring package authors (with an initial focus on R)
can easily add CICD to pharmaverse R packages (the next-generation of clinical reporting tools) 
and related biostastical packages.

Our aim is not to re-invent the wheel, but instead provide context and fill in the gaps within
the domain of devops, by data scientists, in late-stage drug development.

## Getting started with CICD
A recomended plan for success in implenting CICD on your project is to:

- Read this post on the general anatomy of a `gh-action` [TODO]
- Browse our recomended `gh-action`'s below
- Review this case study of CICD is used in `admiral`
- Implement CICD on your git repo!

We've also collected togther this list of external learning resources here: [TODO]
