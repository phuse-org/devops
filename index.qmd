## Welcome to the home of **PharmaDevOps**
This PHUSE working group is focussed on ensuring package authors (with an initial focus on R)
can easily add CICD to pharmaverse R packages (the next-generation of clinical reporting tools) 
and related biostastical packages.

Our aim is not to re-invent the wheel, but instead provide context and fill in the gaps within
the domain of devops, by data scientists, in late-stage drug development.

## Getting started with CICD
A recomended plan for success in implenting CICD on your project is to:

- Read this post on the general anatomy of a `gh-action` [TODO]
- Browse our recomended `gh-action`'s below
- Review this case study of CICD is used in `admiral`
- Implement CICD on your git repo!

We've also collected togther this list of external learning resources here: [TODO]

<!--# Notes on getting started 
Provide a master version (e.g. here's a single file with all the recomended) [TODO]
How the triggers work is confusing, and changing CICD based on what's happening (PR to specific branch) - deeper dive on how to automate checks in workflow, e.g. catch bugs before main [TODO]
Ensure we put upfront what the benefit is for each recomended (e.g. coverage gives you a badge, version bumping updates your description file, keeping built artifacts like docs out of the main code, etc) [TODO]
Flag important parameters with notes in the gh-action code so users can understand what's going on [TODO]
Enabling advanced workflows - e.g. test against current prod branch of the pharmaverse r-universe [TODO]
Should we have badge if they meet minimum cicd? [TODO]

## Minimum CICD

The following CICD is what we consider a minimum bar for a 
package on the pharmaverse. These CICD tools are focussed on 
ensuring your package works, and documentation matches the code.

## Recommended CICD

The following CICD are tools we feel make your life developing and 
releasing robust code easier.
