GitHub Actions are a powerful automation and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate various tasks and workflows in response to events that occur in your GitHub repositories. Actions are defined using `YAML` files that specify the workflow to be executed. The workflow file typically has a `.yml` extension. Below is an explanation of the key syntax elements in a GitHub Actions workflow file as an annotated example:

```yaml
# Name: You can specify a name for your workflow.
# This is a human-readable description of the workflow
# and is not required for the workflow to function.
name: My CI/CD Workflow

# on: This specifies the events that trigger the workflow.
# You can set it to various events like pushes to a
# repository, pull requests, or even a schedule.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

# jobs: This is the main section of the workflow file.
# It defines the jobs that are to be executed when
# the workflow is triggered.
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specifies the type of virtual
    # machine or runner on which the job will run. GitHub
    # provides various runners for different platforms,
    # including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
    steps: # Contains a list of steps that are executed
    # in the specified order. Steps are individual
    # tasks within a job.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
