Calculating this via CICD is useful as the amount of untested code can vary, e.g. a new feature is added but it is not tested.\nIt’s important to note that code coverage is only telling you if a test exists, not that the test is testing all that should be tested against that line of code.\nFor information on how to add testing to R packages, R-pkgs.org covers setting up tests with test that."

To reflect that, this gh-action is updated to run across the last 3 R major versions, using a snapshot from the Posit Public Manager that reflects a relevant time frame for when that R version was latest.\nIf you have dependencies on other pharmaverse packages, it’s likely you will also want to run R CMD Check using CRAN today + the bleading edge of the pharmaverse (which may be pre-CRAN) via pointing at their r-universe.
