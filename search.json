Calculating this via CICD is useful as the amount of untested code can vary, e.g. a new feature is added but it is not tested.\nIt’s important to note that code coverage is only telling you if a test exists, not that the test is testing all that should be tested against that line of code.\nFor information on how to add testing to R packages, R-pkgs.org covers setting up tests with test that."
