## About the gh-action

**Lifecycle stage:** Not reported 

**Example of use:** [teal R package](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml)

**Source:** Pharmaverse gh-action maintained by Roche/Genentech

**Expected output:** Generate and deploy to gh-pages versioned documentation, and upload copy of documentation to release.

## Why should I use this?

`pkgdown` is the most common framework for rendering R package documentation into a an HTML website. 
 Generating and uploading documentation manually makes it very easy for differences
to be present 


## How do I set it up?

You can call this action via adding a call to this job in a github action. A minimal example 
that runs this on commits to main is:

```bash
---
name: Docs ðŸ“š

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docs:
    name: Pkgdown Docs ðŸ“š
    uses: insightsengineering/r.pkg.template/.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml@main
    secrets:
      REPO_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.REPO_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    with:
      default-landing-page: latest-tag
```

## The deets

If you have built docs locally in the past, you are probably aware that your git repo will balloon in size, as it stores a copy 
of each piece version of every plot and image you have used in your documentation. This `gh-action` will help you avoid that, by 
placing the versioned documentation into an orphan branch. Helping to keep your docs (a built artefact) seperate from your source code.

The `gh-action` is well documented in-line, [and stored at this location](https://github.com/insightsengineering/r.pkg.template/blob/main/.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml).
