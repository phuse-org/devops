## About the gh-action

**Lifecycle stage:** Not reported 

**Example of use:** [admiral R package](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralci#links)

**Source:** Pharmaverse gh-action maintained by Roche/Genentech

**Expected output:** Fail the pipeline if a link is broken in your repo.
:::

## Why should I use this?

As a codebase grows, it becomes more likely you will end up with a number of links in your documentation. 
These links can over time stop working - and often you won't know till a user flags your links or broken.

This `gh-action` lets you stay on top of broken links, by actively scanning for them.

## How do I set it up?

Below is an example of using this `gh-action` whenever someone tries to make PR into your `main` or `devel` branch.


```bash
---
name: Docs ðŸ“š

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - devel
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - devel

jobs:
  links:
    name: Links
    uses: pharmaverse/admiralci/.github/workflows/links.yml@main
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

## The deets

This gh-action uses lychee. If you need to prevent false positive deadlinks stopping the 
process, you can use a `.lycheeignore` file. There is an example of this file [from 
admiral here](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/blob/devel/.lycheeignore).
