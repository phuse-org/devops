## About the gh-action

[**Link to `gh-action`**](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralci/blob/main/.github/workflows/r-cmd-check.yml)

**Example of use:** ADD

**Expected output:** Fail the pipeline if `R CMD Check` fails.
:::

## Why should I use this?

`R CMD Check` has [around 50 checks](https://r-pkgs.org/R-CMD-check.html), but the general jist is it will check your package is fit to install, and as part of that process run the unit tests. In many companies, you will 
be running potentially multiple versions of R in parrallel. To reflect 
that, this gh-action is updated to run across the last 3 R major versions, 
using a snapshot from the Posit Public Manager that reflects a relevant time frame for when that R version was latest.

If you have dependencies on other pharmaverse packages, it's likely you will also want to run `R CMD Check` using CRAN today + the bleading edge of the pharmaverse (which may be pre-CRAN) via pointing at their r-universe. If this is the case, please see the advanced usage below.

## How do I set it up?

Below is an example of using this `gh-action` whenever someone tries to make PR into your `main` or `devel` branch or updates the branch. We recomend you use this on both `main` and `devel` branches, as it will help you catch issues before they get into your main branch.


```bash
---
name: R CMD Check

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - devel
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - devel

jobs:
  check:
    name: Check
    uses: pharmaverse/admiralci/.github/workflows/r-cmd-check.yml@main
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
```

## Advanced use

TODO: Add here how to also run against pharmaverse's r-universe latest & the latest release of PPM packages.
