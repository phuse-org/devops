## About the gh-action

**Example of use:** [falcon R package](https://github.com/pharmaverse/falcon/blob/use-phuse-cicd/.github/workflows/phuse-basics.yml)

**Expected output:** Fail the pipeline if a link is broken in your repo (**CHECK IT DOES THIS**)
:::

## Why should I use this?

As a codebase grows, it becomes more likely you will end up with a number of links in your documentation. 
These links can stop working over time - and often you won't know till a user flags your links are broken.

This `gh-action` lets you stay on top of broken links, by actively scanning for them.

## How do I set it up?

Below is an example of using this `gh-action` whenever someone tries to make PR into your `main` or `devel` branch.


```bash
name: Check URLs in docs ðŸ“š
# sourced from phuse-org/devops-toolkit

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened
      - ready_for_review
    branches:
      - main
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  links:
    name: Links
    uses: phuse-org/devops-toolkit/.github/workflows/urlchecker.yml@main
```

## The deets

This `gh-action` is using https://urlchecker.r-lib.org/, so is specific to R packages.
