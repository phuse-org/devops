## About the gh-action

**Example of use:** [admiral R package](https://github.com/insightsengineering/thevalidatoR/blob/main/readme_files/report-0.1-admiral.pdf)

**Expected output:** A PDF attached to a release.
:::

## Why should I use this?

Validation is not a fixed term, and it is strongly recommended to make yourself aware of the work of the R Validation Hub (https://www.pharmar.org/), including the 
regulatory repo project.

When using an R package, it is important to know that what the documentation claims the package does is tested, and these tests pass on the 
environment you will be using. This gh-action generates a generic report, that takes the documentation and links it to the 
unit tests, and records how the the tests performed against a specific R environment. 

The aim here is to who in a pan-company way to document the relationship between documentation and tests. Before 
using internally, you would need to 1) confirm the documentation is well written, 2) the unit tests are sufficient to 
test that documentation and 3) you are assessing against the actual environments you use internally.

## How do I set it up?

Below is an example of using this `gh-action` when a release is made.


```bash
---
name: R Package Validation report

on: # Run this action when a release is published
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  r-pkg-validation:
    name: Create report üìÉ
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: rocker/verse:4.1.1
    # Set Github token permissions
    env:
      GITHUB_PAT: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    permissions:
      contents: write
      packages: write
      deployments: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo üõé
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Build report üèó
        id: validation
        uses: insightsengineering/thevalidatoR@main
        # see parameters above for custom templates and other formats

      # Upload the validation report to the release
      - name: Upload report to release üîº
        if: success()
        uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2
        with:
          file: ${{ steps.validation.outputs.report_output_filename }}
          asset_name: ${{ steps.validation.outputs.report_output_filename }}
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          tag: ${{ github.ref }}
          overwrite: false
```
